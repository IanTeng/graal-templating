# Spring Boot example with external script provider

How to use Spring Boot starter and retrieve the JS script from external server.

To simplify the setup the same Spring Boot server is used to host the script source file and to execute the script logic.

Within tests Spring Boot server is always started on port 8080.

To check if code is in fact working: `./gradlew :examples:spring-boot:test`.

Important elements:
* TemplatingController.java - listens on `/` and `/{name}` paths. Returns markup generated by React script.
* SpringBootExampleApplication - Spring Boot entrypoint
* SpringBootExampleApplicationConfiguration - configuration of JavascriptRenderer and exposing bundle.js file through `/assets/bundle.js` URL.
* js/src/Hello.jsx - HelloWorld React component definition
* js/src/index.js - registering React components and globally exposing the render function
* package.json - defines local dependency on 'graal-bridge-react'. In your project use the npm package '@wttech/graal-bridge-react'.
* webpack.config.js - minimal configuration for a webpack / React project. Aliases for resolving 'react' and 'react-dom' are defined to battle issues related to how peer dependencies of local dependencies are handled.
* TemplatingControllerTest.java - testing TemplatingController endpoint with WebTestClient.
